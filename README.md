# 🔐 Text-Based Encryption & Decryption Tool

This is a simple Python-based tool that allows users to **encrypt and decrypt text** using the **Fernet encryption method** from the `cryptography` library.

## 📌 Features
✔ **No files required** – Directly enter text for encryption & decryption.  
✔ **AES-based encryption** for strong security.  
✔ **Secret key mechanism** – Only users with the key can decrypt messages.  
✔ **Easy to use** with a simple menu-driven interface.

## 🚀 Installation
### **1️⃣ Install Python Dependencies**
Make sure you have Python installed, then install the required library:

```bash
pip install cryptography
```

---

## 🔧 Usage
### **2️⃣ Run the Script**
```bash
python text_encryptor.py
```

### **3️⃣ Choose an Option**
Once you run the script, you'll see:

```
🔐 Text Encryption/Decryption Tool
1️⃣ Generate Key
2️⃣ Encrypt Text
3️⃣ Decrypt Text
Enter your choice (1/2/3): 
```

#### **🔑 Option 1: Generate Key**
Before encrypting or decrypting, generate a **secret key** (only once):

```
Enter your choice (1/2/3): 1
✅ Secret key generated and saved as 'secret.key'
```

#### **🔒 Option 2: Encrypt Text**
To encrypt a message, choose option `2` and enter your text:

```
Enter your choice (1/2/3): 2
Enter the text to encrypt: hello
🔒 Encrypted Text: gAAAAABl... (encrypted data)
```

#### **🔓 Option 3: Decrypt Text**
To decrypt a message, choose option `3` and enter the **encrypted text**:

```
Enter your choice (1/2/3): 3
Enter the text to decrypt: gAAAAABl... (paste encrypted text)
🔓 Decrypted Text: hello
```

## 🛠 How It Works
1. **Fernet encryption** is used to securely encrypt and decrypt text.
2. A **secret key** is generated and stored in `secret.key` (you must generate it once).
3. Encrypted text can only be decrypted using the same **secret key**.

---

## 📝 Notes
- If you lose `secret.key`, you **cannot decrypt** any text.
- Always **generate the key once** and reuse it.
